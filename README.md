# Laravel-Vue

A boilerplate focused on Laravel as backend and Vue as SPA. Also using bulma. 👍🏻

## Getting Started

```
npm install
composer install
php artisan key:generate
php artisan serve & npm run hot
```

A browser will start pointing to localhost:3000, just change the port to 8000.

## Where

Vue SPA is at 'resources/assets/js/app.js'.
